  abstract = {The problem of measuring differential angle of arrival through two relatively small apertures of variable separation is considered. The motivation is to evaluate the practicality of a measurement program using such a quantity to observe atmospheric turbulence wave-front distortion effects when one end of the link is moving and cannot be tracked precisely. (If precise tracking were possible, then measurement of the angular resolution with a single aperture could be used to characterize the propagation path.) Theoretical results for the mean-square difference in angle of arrival are developed and numerical results are presented. Comparison of expected magnitude of effects with available measurement instrument precision indicates that the experiment should be possible, but will depend on our ability to achieve an rms single-axis angle-of-arrival measurement precision of the order of 0.1 arc sec or better.},

  abstract = {The near-ultraviolet circular dichroism (CD) of three homogeneous anti-type III pneumococcal antibodies in the absence and the presence of the specific hexasaccharide ligand was studied. In addition recombinations and hybridizations of H and L chains derived from two of these antibodies were carried out and the CD spectra of bound and free reconstituted IgG molecules were measured. The results indicate that the CD spectra of the native antibodies in the 260-310-nm range are very similar in shape and sign and exhibit a positive band at 285 nm. The homologous reconstituted antibody molecules exhibited CD spectra very similar in shape and sign to those of the native antibody molecules although recombinant molecules are no longer stabilized by interchain disulfide bonds. Upon addition of the hexasaccharide ligand, a significant decrease in amplitude of the CD spectra (18-21\%) occurred in all three native antibodies and their Fab fragments as well as in the homologous recombinant molecules. No CD spectral changes could be detected upon interaction of the hapten ligand with the heterologous recombinants. All homogeneous antibodies studied exhibited fluorescence quenching upon oligosaccharide binding and a blue shift of the emission maximum. This property allowed the determination of the binding constant of one selected antibody to be made. Taken together, CD and fluorescence spectroscopic data suggest that oligosaccharide ligands induced detectable conformational changes in the Fab fragment of the antibody.},

Minor amounts of other products are formed from the diol. The requirements for activity of rabbit liver microsomal 12alpha-hydroxylase resemble those of rat liver microsomes. Of a number of enzyme inhibitors studied only p-chloromercuribenzoate demonstrated a marked ability to inhibit the reaction with either tritiated substrate. There was no difference in the quantity of product produced from the tritiated acid or the 14C-labeled acid. No clear sex difference was found in activity of the enzyme, nor was an appreciable difference noted in activity of the enzyme between mature and immature animals.},

The enzymes released all the alpha-linked mannose residues from each oligosaccharide and were most effective on the smallest substrate. Enzyme A in each case was less active on the oligosaccharides than alpha-mannosidase B2, even though the apparent Km value for the substrates was the same with each enzyme. The human acidic alpha-mannosidases were also found to be more active on substrates isolated from human rather than bovine mannosidosis urine. Human alpha-mannosidase C, which has a neutral pH optimum when assayed with a synthetic substrate, did not hydrolyse any of the oligosaccharides at neutral pH, but was found to be active at an acidic pH.},

  volume = {14},
  issn = {0006-2960},
  abstract = {The properties of the functional groups in a protein can be used as built-in-probes of the structure of the protein. We have developed a general procedure whereby the ionization constant and chemical reactivity of solitary functional groups in proteins may be determined. The method may be applied to the side chain of histidine, tyrosine, lysine, and cysteine, as well as to the amino terminus of the protein. The method, which is an extension of the competitive labeling technique using [3H]- and [14C]1-fluoro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (N2ph-F) in a double-labeling procedure, is rapid and sensitive. Advantage is taken of the fact that after acid hydrolysis of a dinitrophenylated protein, a derivative is obtained which must be derived from a unique position in the protein. The method has been applied to the solitary histidine residue of lysozyme, alpha-lytic protease, and Streptomyces griseus (S.G.) trypsin, as well as to the amino terminus of the latter protein. The following parameters were obtained for reaction with N2ph-F at 20 degrees C in 0.1 N KCl: the histidine of hen egg-white lysozyme, pKa of 6.4 and second-order velocity constant of 0.188 M-1 min-1; the histidine of alpha-lytic protease, pKa of 6.5 and second-order velocity constant of 0.0235 M-1 min-1; the histidine of S.G. trypsin, pKa of 6.5 and second-order velocity constant of 0.0328 M-1 min-1; the valyl amino terminus of S.G. trypsin, pKa of 8.1 and second-order velocity constant of 0.403 M-1 min-1. In addition, the results obtained provide clues as to the microenvironments of these functional groups, and indicate that the proteins studied undergo pH-dependent conformational changes which affect the microenvironment, and hence the chemical reactivity of these groups.},

  abstract = {The free and bound forms of alpha,alpha-trehalase (EC 3.2.1.28) of the honey bee thorax were separated and the bound enzyme was solubilized by raising the pH to 8.0 for 10 h. Both enzymes were purified. They were homogeneous as determined by several electrophoretic criteria. It was found that the two enzymes had very similar Km's (each about 0.89 mM), Vm's (53.2 and 54.3 U/mg for free and solubilized, respectively), inhibition characteristics, specificities (both only hydrolyzed alpha,alpha-trehalose), pH maxima (each had maxima at about 3.5 and 6.5), molecular weights (65,000), isoelectric points (5.1), reactivities to sulfhydryl reagents, electrophoretic mobilities, activation energies (about 12.8 kcal/mol), and similar stabilities to heat, pH, and urea. Some significant differences between the two enzymes were, however, found: the solubilized alpha,alpha-trehalase floated at 70\% saturation of ammonium sulfate while the free alpha,alpha-trehalase did not; the solubilized alpha,alpha-trehalase did not dissociate into subunits as readily as did the free one; and the solubilized alpha,alpha-trehalase was found to bind more readily to a hydrophobic grouping than the free enzyme. In addition to these comparisons, three new findings relating to thorax alpha,alpha-trehalases are reported. (1) Thorax alpha,alpha-trehalases are strongly inhibited by beta-glucosides (Ki values of about 8 x 10(-4) M); (2) under certain conditions thorax alpha,alpha-trehalases from honey bees dissociated into subunits of one-half the normal molecular weight; (3) honey bee thorax alpha,alpha-trehalases have unusual biphasic pH activity profiles.},

  abstract = {A transplantable mouse testicular teratoma (OTT 6050) which displays a spectrum of neuroepithelial differentiation was evaluated biochemically for concentrations of cyclic AMP (cAMP), serotonin (5-HT), and enzymes involved in the metabolism of the biogenic amines and acetylcholine. These values were compared between teratomas with neuroepithelial differentiation as the major or minor component and brains of neonatal and adult mice of related strains. cAMP, 5-HT, tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH), aromatic amino acid decarboxylase (AADC) and monoamine oxidase (MAO) were present. In addition, enzymes of the adrenergic system, i.e. tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and dopamine-beta-hydroxylase (DBH), and of the cholinergic system, i.e. choline acetyltransferase and acetylcholinesterase, were studied. Biochemical differences in tumor groups probably reflected variations in the proportion of neuroepithelial components: trends suggested an increase of cAMP and an increased activity of TPH, AADC, TH and DBH in tumors with increased proportions of neuroepithelial cells. These findings indicate that the neuroepithelial component of the mouse teratoma may serve as a model for the study of neuronal differentiation in primitive neuroepithelial neoplasms.},

The rates at which the same drugs diffused from the blood plasma (under conditions of constant drug concentration) into the ruminal solution were also evaluated. These compounds were absorbed by simple diffusion, and the rates of transfer were a function of pH of the intraruminal solution. The diffusion of drugs from plasma into the reticulorumen allowed steady-state distributions to be established in some goats. The theoretical and observed steady-state distributions were compared. There were good correlations for pentobarbital and antipyrine, but not for salicylate and quinine. These findings confirm in vivo the general principles of drug transfer across ruminal epithelium that were derived from previous studies conducted in vitro.},
